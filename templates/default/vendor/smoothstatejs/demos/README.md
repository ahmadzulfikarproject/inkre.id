# Demos with smoothState.js

If you don't have a local webserver, you can [view the demos here](https://rawgit.com/miguel-perez/smoothState.js/master/demos/index.html).

## Install

To install the demos, copy all files to the root of your local webserver.

If you have python installed, you can simply run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` after you `cd` into the demos directory.

Alternatively, you can use the built-in static webserver.

1. Install Node.js dependencies: `npm install http-server`
2. Start webserver `npm http-server ./ -p 8080`
3. You can now access the demo site under [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080)
